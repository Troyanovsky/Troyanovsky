- 👋 Hi, I’m @Troyanovsky
- 👀 I’m a product manager during my day, but I often code some small projects while learning new stuff in my spare time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack web dev with Vue and Node.js.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in EdTech, HealthTech, Productivity Tools, or anything that could make people's lives better! These projects can be just MVP/Proof-of-concept to bigger ones.
- 📫 How to reach me: gzhao1997@gmail.com
